First add 1 tablespoon of any vanilla flavoured milk powder.
Then place the dark fantasy biscuit on the powder.
Now add milk only until the dark fantasy biscuit sinks in the milk.
Then smash the biscuit into small bits with a spoon.
Now pour the milk until the glass is almost full.
Then stir it 4-5 times and wait for sometime.
And your galaxy milk is ready.
